Welcome to AP CS A! Before we write any computer programs,
we'll think about why programming is useful.

A minor note on logistics:
Feel free to take notes wherever. You can use Google Docs, 
paper, whatever. These notes will always be available online.
In the future, they'll be less verbose. 

1) What is programming? 

Most of y'all completed a PB&J activity where you thought
about giving specific, step-by-step instructions to someone else.
Programming is that process, just the "someone else" is a computer,
and your instructions are in a language like Java, not English.

Literally, programming is the process of writing computer programs.
To do this, a programmer gives a list of instructions to a computer
to execute. If you've ever followed a recipe or used Google Maps 
to get to your friend's house, YOU were the computer, since you
were the one following the instructions. More generally, programming
isn't just the process of typing these commands out. We need to know
how the computer will interpret those commands, in what order to
write commands, and how to fix our code if the commands don't work.

2) Thinking algorithmically

In order to communicate with computers, we need to know how computers
think. An algorithm is a precise, step-by-step list of instructions
for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. You probably learned
the importance of thinking algorithmically during the PB&J activity.
If you weren't precise, then your instructions weren't followed well!

Thinking algorithmically will eventually let us break down complex
problems into a set of smaller steps. This will be valuable, even if
you never write another computer program after this class. It'll be
a way to think about accomplishing things even without a computer.
In this class, it'll help us write complex computer programs by 
combining more simple commands. We might not think of making 
sandwiches as complex, but if you had to explain how to make one
to someone, wouldn't a list of instructions be an acceptable way?
